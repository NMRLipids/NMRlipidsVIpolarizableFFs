%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.
%%
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".
%%
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}

This project is performed using the "NMRLipids Databank" format and all related files, except the trajectories, are available under\\ "https://github.com/batukav/NMRlipidsVIpolarizableFFs/"
Order parameters are calculated using the script "OrderParameters.py" under\\ "https://github.com/batukav/NMRlipidsVIpolarizableFFs/tree/master/scripts". \\
Dihedral distributions are calculated using the script "calcDihedral.py" under\\ "https://github.com/batukav/NMRlipidsVIpolarizableFFs/tree/master/scripts" .\\
