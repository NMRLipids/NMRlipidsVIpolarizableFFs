%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author

%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each

%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".

%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

	\caption{The head group and glycerol backbone order parameters $S_{CH}$ for the POPC simulations. The experimental values on the dashed lines mean that the different isomers 1/2 experimentally could not be resolved.}
	\label{fig:popc_order}
        \todo{SAMULI: I am not sure if we need this kind of figure. Systems without ions are in separate figures as well as dependence on ions.}
\end{figure}

	\includegraphics{popc_order_parameters_nosalt.png}
	\caption{The head group and glycerol backbone order parameters $S_{CH}$ for the POPC simulations without salt.}
	\label{fig:popc_order_no_salt}
        \todo{SAMULI: It would be good to put the experimental value also to second hydrogen even though it would be the same as for first.
          Now it looks like that those values would not be known.} \\
        \todo{SAMULI: y-axis should be more zoomed in.} \\
        \todo{SAMULI: Similar figure for POPE (now figure 4) could be here as panel B).}

	\caption{The change in the head group order parameters with respect to the simulations without salt as a function of the salt concentration.}
	\label{fig:popc_order_parameter_change}
        \todo{SAMULI: y-axis scale should be much more zoomed in here, particularly the difference in experiments between sodium and calcium must be visible.} \\
        \todo{SAMULI: We should also show the ion density profiles along membrane normal and compare the ones with 1000 mM NaCl and 350 mM CaCl$_2$
          (concentration in bulk water) to the best profiles in the literature (Fig. 5 in http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12510).
          This will show the actual difference in ion binding to the best performing models available.}

          Or were you planning to discuss why order parameter response to ions is qualitatively incorrect in Drude PC?
          If yes, then maybe remove POPE from this figure.

          Also, colors, lines styles and/or widths could be better used to distinguish common and different elements in each line.
        For example, CHARMM36 with thick lines, drude thin lines, POPC black, POPE red, or something like that.}
